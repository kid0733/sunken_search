🚤 Coast Guard Search and Rescue Python Program

Welcome to the Coast Guard Search and Rescue Python project! As the director of search and rescue operations for the Cape Python region, your mission is to find a missing fisherman using Bayes' rule. Armed with information about the fisherman's last known position, abandonment of ship, and environmental conditions, your Python program will calculate the probability of his current whereabouts.

🔍 Key Features:

Utilizes Bayes' rule for probability calculation.
Considers factors such as last known position, abandonment details, ocean currents, wind direction, and more.
Simulates the search and rescue scenario for the Cape Python region.
Incorporates environmental factors like water temperature and flotation device impact on survival.

🌊 Challenges:

Dynamic representation of ocean currents off Cape Python.
Consideration of wind direction, visibility, and wave conditions.
Simulation of hypothermia onset if the fisherman is immersed.

🌐 Next Steps:

Clone the repository to explore the Python program.
Customize parameters to simulate different search and rescue scenarios.
Collaborate with the community to enhance the program and contribute to the Coast Guard's mission.

⚓ Note:
In real-life scenarios, the Coast Guard employs sophisticated tools like SAROPS for optimal planning. This project serves as a simplified, educational tool for understanding the basics of search and rescue operations.

Happy Coding and Safe Rescues! 🚁🌊
